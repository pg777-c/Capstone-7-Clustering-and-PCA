THE TASK BRIEF AS SET-OUT BELOW.

Compulsory Task 1

This dataset is from the US Arrests Kaggle challenge (link). A description of the data is given as: “This data set contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents,
for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas.”

Follow these steps:

● Use the dataset UsArrests.csv included in this folder to generate a similar in-depth PCA report of the data. Explore as much as you can, motivate the pre-processing steps you take, and interpret the outcomes of any analyses.

● You are also required to do an application of two clustering techniques and an analysis of the clusters they generate. Try and see if you can find anything common within each cluster that has been found.

● Push all the work that you have generated for this project to GitHub.
